## 1. Executive Summary

**Sherlock is a real-time system that verifies *who is actually sitting the interview* — continuously, with a confidence score and a human-readable justification — without ever being given a reference photo or voice sample up front.**

Online interviews are easy to cheat: a stand-in ("proxy") can join under the candidate's
name, the real candidate can hand the laptop to an expert for the hard questions, or the
participant can simply show up as `Guest` with the camera off. Trusting the meeting
platform's participant list ("the person named *John Doe* is John Doe") fails against all
of these.

Sherlock takes a fundamentally different approach: it **infers identity from a fusion of
independent biometric and behavioural signals** (face, voice, speaker activity, lip-sync,
meeting events), treats meeting metadata as the *weakest* input, and **builds the
candidate's reference identity from the interview itself** — then monitors consistency
against that self-built anchor for the rest of the session.

The output is a live verdict per participant:

> **Candidate: John Doe · Confidence: 94% · State: IDENTIFIED**
> *Reasons: ✓ Voice stayed dominant · ✓ Same face present throughout · ✓ Lip-sync consistent*

---

## 2. The Problem

| Attack / Edge case | Why naive metadata fails |
|---|---|
| **Proxy interview** | A stand-in joins under the candidate's name and answers questions. |
| **Candidate switching** | Real candidate answers the easy questions, then hands off to an expert. |
| **Generic display names** | Participant shows as `iPhone`, `Guest`, `User`, `Galaxy S23`. |
| **Camera off** | No face signal — the system must fall back to voice + behaviour. |
| **Audio drops / network blips** | Signals vanish temporarily and must **not** collapse the verdict. |

**Design principle:** identity is a *probabilistic belief maintained over time*, not a
database lookup. Meeting metadata is used only as a weak tie-breaker.

---

## 3. How It Works

### 3.1 Evidence Fusion
Each incoming signal is a piece of **evidence** with a source, weight, reliability, and
timestamp. A stateful **Confidence Engine** maintains per-participant belief, decays stale
evidence over time, and computes a score plus the reasons behind it.

```
Signals (weak, noisy, async)                 Belief (strong, explainable)
──────────────────────────                   ────────────────────────────
Face embedding match      ─┐
Face continuously present  │
Speaker is active          ├──►  EVIDENCE  ──►  CONFIDENCE  ──►  Candidate: John Doe
Voice consistency          │      FUSION        ENGINE          Confidence: 94%
Lip-sync (face↔voice)      │                   (stateful)       State: IDENTIFIED
Meeting events             │                                    Reasons: [ ... ]
Metadata (name) [weakest] ─┘
```

### 3.2 Zero-Knowledge Cold Start (the hard part)
Sherlock starts with **zero biometric knowledge** of the candidate — no uploaded
reference. It builds the reference *during* the interview and then checks consistency
against it, moving through a state machine:

```
OBSERVING          →   ANCHORING                    →   IDENTIFIED / MONITORING
(0 knowledge)          (build self-reference)            (check consistency vs anchor)
collect face & voice   online-cluster embeddings;        same face throughout?
embeddings from all    bind dominant FACE ↔ VOICE        same voice answering?
participants           via lip-sync; lock anchor         did identity drift / switch?
```

### 3.3 Verdict States
`OBSERVING` · `ANCHORING` · `UNCERTAIN` · **`IDENTIFIED`** · **`PROXY_SUSPECTED`** ·
**`CANDIDATE_SWITCHED`** · `SIGNAL_LOST` · `LEFT`

---

## 4. System Architecture

Sherlock is an **event-driven microservice system**. Every service is decoupled through a
Kafka event bus with Protobuf-defined schemas as the single source of truth. Backend
services follow a **hexagonal (ports & adapters) architecture**.

## 6. What's Built (Milestones)

The system was built **incrementally by milestone**, each with a demoable exit criterion.
A key architectural decision was a **signal simulator** that drives the entire data plane
with scripted signals — proving the full end-to-end architecture *before* wiring in the
heavy ML, and keeping every milestone independently demoable.

| Milestone | Deliverable | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **M0** | Foundations & Protobuf contracts; Kafka produce→consume smoke test | ✅ Complete |
| **M1** | Meeting Service + REST API + Postgres | ✅ Complete |
| **M2** | Skeleton data plane (mock anchor → fusion → confidence) + signal simulator | ✅ Complete |
| **M3** | WebSocket gateway fan-out + Next.js live dashboard | ✅ Complete |
| **M4** | Timeline + English explanation engine + proxy CRITICAL alerts | ✅ Complete |
| **M5** | Real video AI: webcam → MinIO → InsightFace embeddings → signals | ✅ Code-complete |
| **M6+** | Real audio / identity-anchor AI, model hardening, production readiness | 🔜 Roadmap |

**Milestones M0–M4 are fully demoable end-to-end today** with zero ML, driven by the
signal simulator. M5 (real webcam face processing) is implemented and containerised.

## 7. Running the Project

**Prerequisite:** Docker Desktop.

```bash
# 1) Clone
git clone https://github.com/Unocoder07/sherlock.git
cd sherlock
cp .env.example .env

# 2) Bring up the stack (infra + all services + dashboard)
docker compose up -d

# 3) Open the dashboard
#    http://localhost:3000
#    paste a meeting id (any UUID) and click "Watch" — status dot turns green (Live)

# 4) Drive a live verdict into that meeting with the signal simulator (no ML needed)
cd backend
./gradlew :tools:signal-simulator:run --args="--scenario cold-start --meeting <the-uuid>"
```

Watch the dashboard update **live**: the state badge climbs `OBSERVING → UNCERTAIN →
IDENTIFIED`, the confidence gauge rises, and the reason bars populate.

### Demo scenarios
| Scenario | Result |
|---|---|
| `cold-start` | → **✓ IDENTIFIED** |
| `proxy` / `relay` | → **! PROXY_SUSPECTED** (red banner) |
| `switch` | → **⇄ CANDIDATE_SWITCHED** |
| `camera-off` | held by voice — no false proxy |

> **Note on hardware:** the full 16-container stack (incl. the InsightFace ML service)
> needs ~8 GB+ of RAM headroom. On a constrained machine, run
> `docker compose up -d --scale video-processing=0` and use the signal simulator — this
> demonstrates the complete architecture and live verdict flow without the ML service.

## 8. Engineering Highlights

- **Event-driven, not request-driven** — every service communicates through Kafka topics,
  so the pipeline is decoupled, replayable, and horizontally scalable.
- **Contract-first** — Protobuf schemas are the single source of truth; Java and Python
  stubs are generated, so services can never drift out of sync on the wire format.
- **Hexagonal architecture** — domain logic is isolated behind ports; Kafka, Postgres, and
  Redis are swappable adapters. Domain code has no framework imports.
- **Explainability by design** — the verdict is never a black box; every score carries the
  weighted contributions that produced it, rendered into English reasons.
- **Zero-knowledge cold start** — the system's hardest and most novel piece: building a
  trusted identity reference from an untrusted live stream.
- **Resilience to signal loss** — evidence decays gracefully; a dropped camera or audio
  blip does not collapse a confident verdict into a false alarm.
- **Testable in isolation** — the signal simulator replays proxy / switch / camera-off /
  network-drop scripts and asserts the resulting state transitions.
